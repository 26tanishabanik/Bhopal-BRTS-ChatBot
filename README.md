# VIT Bhopal University - Developing an AI Chatbot for Bhopal BRTS Navigation with Multilingual Assistance

### Challenge Background
As Bhopal grows, the need for efficient public transportation becomes increasingly critical. The Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) is a key component of the city's transit network, providing reliable service through its red buses. Despite its importance, many commuters struggle with the BRTS due to unfamiliarity with routes and language barriers, leading to confusion and inefficiencies.

Navigating BRTS routes can be complex, especially for those who are not fluent in the local language or new to the city. This challenge affects first-time users, tourists and non-native speakers who may find it difficult to understand schedules, routes and ticketing procedures.

To address these issues, an AI-driven chatbot with natural language processing (NLP) capabilities is proposed. This chatbot will offer real-time, multilingual guidance, including Hindi, to help users navigate the BRTS more effectively. By providing step-by-step navigation, accurate bus schedules and traffic updates, the chatbot aims to enhance the commuting experience and encourage greater use of public transportation. Ultimately, this solution seeks to improve accessibility, reduce confusion and support Bhopal's sustainable urban growth.

### Goal of the Project
The goal of this project is to develop an AI-driven chatbot that provides real-time navigation and route guidance for commuters using Bhopal's Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS). The chatbot will be equipped with natural language processing (NLP) capabilities to support multiple languages, with a primary focus on Hindi, making it accessible to a diverse range of users. By offering step-by-step guidance, real-time bus schedules and traffic condition updates, the chatbot aims to enhance the user experience, promote greater utilization of the BRTS and contribute to the overall improvement of urban mobility in Bhopal.
